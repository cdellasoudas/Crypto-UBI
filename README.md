# Crypto-UBI
A Basic Income Cryptocurrency project
Crypto UBI roadmap

The core idea of this project is to initiate a transition to a Basic Income based economy through introducing an initial injection of value assets in the form of a wide scope cryptocurrency coins mass distribution and subsequently developing this into an economic ecosystem where value flows are recycled from top to bottom through basic income delivery. The system will allow for countercyclical monetary base management operations, optimaly delivered through algorithmic functions embeded in the code.

Steps

1. Initial distribution

Start with an airdrop, a wide initial distribution of a token that is targeted and marketed for a  managed parity to the value of USD, EUR, GBP etc. Anyone who can identify her/himself with a  unique account gets lets say 100.000. This will be open ended and always ongoing. Solving the  uniquely identifiable accounts problem is the tricky part, but not impossible. Premine a few if you need that incentive. 

2. The basic features

Once you have a sufficient user base (at least somewhere between 100.000 to a million users) you can start looking into some form of token recycling and monetary base management. With the use of demurrage and transaction taxes you can remove units from circulation. Part of these funds should be recycled into users unique accounts as basic income. Ideally there would also be an avenue for feeding these funds to community projects and community building. 

3. Monetary base management, countercyclical operations

The monetary base would be managed through burning taxed units or airdroping units into circulation exclusively by feeding them equitably into users unique accounts. 

4. Economic policy management

Economic policy would be set by adjusting demurrage, transaction taxes, Basic Income level, community funding disbursements, burn rates and new coin airdrops into people's unique wallets. This could be done manually initially until a reliable algorithm that can analyse all relevant indicators is developed and embedded in the code. Possibly a new body of economic theory will have to be developed in the process. 

5. The political aspect

It goes without saying that implementing and operating such a project is a highly political process. Community building and management and even some form of new universal statehood are integral and inseparable parts of it. Efficient dispute resolution is also a sine qua non term for a functioning economic ecosystem.
